Transformative Sharing 




The Value Education (VE) Cell in the college is dedicated to promoting holistic education that focuses on personal transformation and the cultivation of values such as empathy, compassion, and integrity. The VE Cell’s efforts have yielded significant results, as many faculty members have reported experiencing personal transformations that have led to qualitative changes in their teaching practices and interpersonal relationships.
Several faculty members have reported that their teaching has improved as a result of the VE Cell’s emphasis on values-based education. They have become more aware of their communication style, developed a deeper understanding of their student’s needs and learning styles, and created more engaging learning experiences for their students. These faculty members have also developed a greater sense of empathy and compassion for their students, which has helped to build stronger and more positive relationships.

The personal transformations experienced by faculty members have not been limited to their professional lives. Many have reported feeling more fulfilled and purposeful in their work, and have developed a greater sense of meaning and direction in their lives. This has led to a deeper connection with their surrounding and a commitment to making a positive difference in the lives of others.
The efforts of the Value Education (VE) Cell have impacted not only the faculty members but also the students. The students have been exposed to the Universal Human Values (UHV) contents as part of the curriculum and the evening workshops. As a result, many have reported experiencing personal transformations.
According to some students, the UHV contents have helped them to develop a greater sense of responsibility towards their bodies, families, societies, and the environment. They have reported feeling more connected to their surroundings and have become more aware of the impact of their actions on the world around them. They have developed a sense of accountability towards their own well-being and the well-being of others.
Moreover, the students have also reported experiencing positive changes in their behavior and attitudes. They have become more respectful towards their teachers and colleagues, and have developed a greater sense of empathy and compassion towards others. They have learned to communicate more effectively and have developed a greater sense of self-awareness, which has helped them to better manage their emotions and make better decisions.
Overall, the VE Cell’s impact on faculty and students has been significant. The promotion of values-based education has helped to create a more positive and meaningful educational environment, which has resulted in personal transformations for many individuals. The efforts of the VE Cell have helped to foster a culture of empathy, compassion, and responsibility, which has benefitted both the individuals and society as a whole.
