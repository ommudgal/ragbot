 Innovations During Covid 19 PandemicDuring the Covid 19 pandemic, AKGEC FabLab developed a low cost yet environmental friendly and reusable products – Respirator and Face shield using 3D printing Technology. 
The respirator was developed using Polylactic Acid. The filter material used was disposable mask cloth but any material as per exposed environment can be used. Design considerations such as suitability for average male / female face size with ergonomic characteristics and perfect fit on the face without causing any problems due to prolonged usage were taken into consideration. The weight of the respirator was 47 grams and average cost of manufacture was INR 100.
