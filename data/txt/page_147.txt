UHV Departmental Seminars 




The College has recognized that UHV (Universal Human Values) concepts are transformative in nature and require time for individuals to fully explore and assimilate. In order to create a conducive environment where students, faculty members, and staff can engage with these concepts, the College has implemented several policies. One of these policies is that each department will hold a UHV seminar every month, led by a faculty member.
The UHV seminars offer an opportunity for participants to engage in deep reflection and dialogue, with the aim of cultivating values such as love, truth and compassion. By exploring UHV concepts, participants will gain a better understanding of themselves, others, and the world around them. Through these seminars, the College aims to foster a community that is committed to personal and collective growth, and to creating positive change in society.
The details of UHV seminars held during the odd semester 2022-23 are as follows;
