PROGRAMMES FOR STUDENTS



PERSONALITY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMES (PDP)

Academic excellence alone is not enough and cannot guarantee a good career. Certain personality attributes and soft skills are essential not only to get a good job but also to be able to contribute and grow in an organization. Taking cognizance of this, the college emphasises all round development through a range of extracurricular activities as well as organizing and conducting formal Personality Development Program.
This programme spanning over 100 hours is conducted by a professional agency and includes training in communication skills, group discussion, interpersonal skills and interviews. This is a mandatory programme for second year B.Tech. and MCA students of the college. This programme helps in the overall personality development of students. The whole exercise is intended to increase the employability of students. Amidst an inspiring and invigorating environment, students undergo training that turns them into top notch professionals.


INFOSYS CAMPUS CONNECT PROGRAM

As a step towards grooming students into perfect professionals and to make them compatible with the IT industry, Infosys campus connect programme (Springboard) is run by T&P department which is conducted by Infosys. Under this programme, Infosys train some identified faculty on emerging courses under Faculty Enabled Program (FEP).
In this program B. Tech III year CSE, IT students undergo training on emerging certification courses by Infosys on Springboard platform under the guidance of trained faculty.
These steps not only help Infosys to reduce their in-house training time but also help the students in acquiring technical skills which make them more suitable for IT industry.
The entire educational process at AKGEC revolves around guiding and providing the students all the imperative and relevant inputs to take on the professional world with conviction and confidence. Thus apart from PDP & Infosys CCP (Springboard) our college also offers modules on ProE, CAT/A etc. leading to certification and helping students to become proficient in the current generation CAD software used in industry.
