 Workshop on “Understanding Science of Relationships through Self-Exploration” (Oct 30-03 Nov, 2023)

Brief Report
VE Cell, AKGEC conducted a 10-hour student offline workshop on “Understanding Science of Relationships through Self-Exploration” from 30 Oct-04 Nov 2023 (2hrs per day). The workshop was conducted by Dr. Akhilesh Verma, Mr. R.P Singh and Dr. Jitendra Chhabra.
The workshop’s objective was to help students to see their innate potential to live a happy life. The problem today is that we fail to understand relationship and feelings (values), and consequently we fail to fulfil it despite all our good intentions. The problems are due to the absence of one or more of the right feelings (values) in the Self. And we try to make up this gap by physical facility or by trying to demand these feelings from others, rather than ensuring these feelings in ourselves and sharing it with others. The workshop was based on an intense exploration of these feelings ‘within’, where students validated the proposals in their daily life issues. The facilitators helped them to see the root cause of problems and their solutions, rather than giving any readymade solution.
The workshop concluded with self-evaluation and sharing of participating students. The impact factor was rated high and commitment to attend more such transformational workshops was expressed.

 

 

 

 
 Art of Living (AoL) Session on Empowering Mental Wellness through Essential Life Skills on 5 Oct 2023

Art of Living (AoL) Session on "Empowering Mental Wellness through Essential Life Skills"


Value Education Cell, AKGEC conducted an Art of Living (AoL) session on “Empowering Mental Wellness through Essential Life Skills" on 5 Oct 2023. Ms. Soma Singh and Mr. Rajeev Agarwal, Art of Living (AoL) Volunteers conducted it in an interactive manner and demonstrated SUDARSHAN KRIYA YOGA (S.K.Y.) for the participants. They stated that while breathing happens automatically, most of us are unaware that working with the breath can give us the ability to manage our minds and emotions. In fact, every emotion we experience has a corresponding rhythm in the breath. By changing the rhythms of breath, we can change our emotions. For example, the breath of peace includes a long and smooth inhale and exhale which turns into a calm and relaxed mind. Around 100 students and faculty members enthusiastically witnessed the event.

Brief Report
A limited hours (within 10day duration) student workshop on the topic “Conscious Engineering” was planned by the VE Cell, AKGEC, 10th June 2023 onwards, under the amiable guidance of Dr Gopal Babu. The objective was to help the explorers see self, the conscious entity; and also the process of self-exploration. During the workshop, we aimed to accomplish the following objectives:
– Increase awareness levels– Develop the ability to counsel oneself– Improve the ability to sense our own and others' emotions– Enhance skills to handle reactions, both internal and external– Strengthen teamwork capabilities– Learn to take breaks when necessary– Improve listening skills– Gain wisdom in distinguishing between right and wrong.
The student workshop was split into multiple interactive sessions, encouraging attendees to ask questions, provide reflections, and actively participate throughout. Everyone was welcome to seek clarification and engage in meaningful discussions.
The steps covered in the workshop were as follows:
1. Be aware – Observe your imagination at this moment, i.e. the desire (feeling), thought, expectation. No Reaction! [MFC: Observation/Conclusion]2. Is the feeling that you have at this moment naturally acceptable to you? [Feelings/Thoughts]3. Are you in harmony, happy with the feeling that you have at this moment?4. Who decided the feeling that you have at this moment? Did you decide it or someone else/situation outside decided it?5. On what basis did you decide the feeling you have at this moment?Did you decide it on the basis of understanding or on the basis of an assumption? [is the feeling based on my assumption/his behaviour or right understanding/reality]6. a) Which feelings are naturally acceptable to you?Feelings of relationship or opposition, harmony or disharmony, co-existence or struggle?6. b) we explore within to understand relationship, harmony, and co-existence in its completeness, in the context of whole nature, existence.7. a) Ensure that the feeling that you have at this moment is in line with the feeling of Relationship, Harmony and Co-existence and not otherwise. On this basis, I will be in a state of harmony and happiness at this moment.7. b) when I am able to understand relationship, harmony and co-existence in its completeness, then, I will be able to decide my feeling, thought accordingly in a natural manner, and I will always be comfortable within, I will be in a state of harmony and happiness in continuity.
As part of an evaluation process, students were provided with a self-assessment form to gauge their comprehension levels. The form included four parameters: ‘awareness’, ‘ability to perceive one's own and others' needs, ‘ability to manage internal and external reactions’, and ‘ability to provide self-counseling’. Upon reviewing the completed forms, it was evident that many students showed improvement in these areas.

Students Feedback :
Vipin Chandra joshi:Before the workshop, I used to react immediately whenever anyone use to trigger me, that always resulted in anger and unstable mind, but after attending the workshop, I try to observe and on the basis of my observation, I evaluate my feelings and competence and then I give reply to the person.
Soumya Shukla:Understanding our consciousness and proper observation has helped me a lot in living a peaceful life. In the past, I used to overthink a lot and that resulted in a lot of anxiety and depression, but after the workshop, it reduced to a greater extent.
Sushant Soni:Through this workshop, I came to know that we should see people on the basis of their feelings and not by the outer behaviour. I came to know the difference between the normal trust and blind trust.
Aditya Sharma:This workshop has helped me a lot in shifting my thoughts from negativity to positivity, there was a time where I used to evaluate things always in a negative way, but now, through this workshop, I always try to focus my mind on positive things.
With the sharing of explorers, the workshop came to an end. The explorer’s feedback was very encouraging and all of them are looking forward for another workshop, where they can learn more about self-exploration, self-awareness and self-evaluation.

 A Spiritual talk by Brahma Kumari (BK) Sangeeta Didi (14 October, 2022)

A report on the Spiritual talk by Brahma Kumari (BK) Sangeeta Didi


A Brief detailing 
Value Education Cell, AKGEC organized a spiritual seminar on ‘HEALTHY, HAPPY AND HARMONIOUS RELATIONSHIPS’ on 14th October 2022 for all the B.Tech 2nd-year students from 10 AM to 12 PM in the Main Seminar Hall of the administrative block.
The speaker of the session was BK Sangeeta Didi. She, as a spiritualist, has been deeply studying the practical applications of Rajyoga meditation and knowledge in varied fields of life for the last 40 years. She has done spiritual services in many places in India as well as in other countries, including Mauritius, Singapore, Malaysia and Russia. Didi has been a regular facilitator at Air India (for their Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Hyderabad and Cochin branches), Jet Airways, Singapore Airlines, Indian Oil Corporation, Ministry of Railways, BHEL, etc.
VE Cell students, Vaishnavi and Aseem, welcomed Didi and briefly introduced the topic to all the dignitaries and audience present in the session. Clarity of relationship and harmony was extracted as everybody’s aspiration, initiating the session. After that, Director General (DG), Dr. RK Agarwal, introduced the esteemed guest BK Sangeeta Didi. He very generously added that he is also under the constant mentoring of Didi. DG’s statement that he is in the “Palna of Didi”, directly touched the audience’s heart and motivated everyone to be more attentive throughout the session.
After DG sir’s address, BK Sangeeta Ji also spoke kind words for such a visionary Director General, who is a guide, a mentor and a well-wisher to his students, rather than only being a Director General of such a prestigious institute. After her one-hour spiritual talk on the topic, she responded to everybody’s questions and doubts with calmness and clarity. She engaged everyone in her speech; the examples she used for better understanding were very much related to day-to-day issues, so they were truly comprehended by everybody. The students and everyone in the hall were impressed and influenced by her simplicity and how she handled the questions. The chanting of OM SHANTI was full of peace and serenity.
She enlightened the minds to understand the real meaning of relationships in life, and she talked about the state of detachment. She perplexed the audience with beautiful lines about relationships like relationships should be based on‘What we think, feel and interpret’ not on ‘what we speak or how we speak’No one is wrong, in fact, ‘Each one of us is different’;Don’t just give advice only, ‘Give blessing to the soul to have the power to change the Sanskaar’.
With these blessed lines, she also told about five equations for a harmonious life, listed below:
Equation 1: Advise their good, not my mind’s happiness.Equation 2: Everyone is right in their own wayEquation 3: Detachment is the best gift for the family because it guarantees that I will be strong and stable whatever happens.Equation 4: I have the potential to respect my pure feelings – whatever happens, being genuine.Equation 5: I will take the initiative to do any pure act.
She helped in observing thoughts, views and issues related to the misconceptions in relationships and gave several examples where life became easy and joyful with the understanding of feelings in a relationship. Various effective examples include mother-children, friends, spouses, etc., and relationships, which almost every one of us often experiences.
Didi also advised everybody to meditate for at least 2-3 minutes between hectic working hours, which certainly boosts productivity, improves mental health, and helps in becoming a better observer of things. She said mediation helps to heal self in difficult situations. She also helped the audience to manage feelings, anger, and emotions while interacting with friends and family.
The session ended with the following homework for the audience to contemplate:I have great respect for myself – I am a peaceful, loving, happy, very powerful soul, come what may.Even if anyone says something or under any circumstances, no disturbance, dejection,doubt on me the “Soul”or feeling disrespected.I will always create blessings for others.

A report on the Workshop on “Conscious Engineering”


Highlights
A limited hours (within 10day duration) student workshop on the topic “Conscious Engineering” was planned by the VE Cell, AKGEC, 10th September 2022 onwards, under the amiable guidance of Dr Gopal Babu, Dr Parul Verma, Prof BN Pandey, Prof RP Singh and Dr Jitendra Chhabra. The objective was to help the explorers seeing self, the conscious entity; and also the process of self-exploration.The student workshop was divided in various sessions. All the sessions were interactive; and explorers were welcomed to ask doubts, meanings, give reflections and participate actively at every point.



The first session was started with the introduction of the topic and some checkpoints to be maintained throughout the workhop. The facilitator, Gopal ji acquainted the explorers about the basic idea of human values, how human mind tends to work logically and remains devoid of feelings in the absence of right understanding, need of Value Education and its complementarity with Skill Education and familiarization with certain terms will be used in the later sessions like self, natural acceptance, right understanding etc.
Further session was continued understanding harmony at various levels, these are-
At the level of individualAt the level of familyAt the level of societyAt the level of nature / existence
While understanding harmony at the level of individual, the proposal shared was- Human being is Co-existence of Self, a consciousness unit and the body, a material unit. The happiness of a person is dependent upon the source of imagination of the person. The sources of imagination may be preconditioning, sensation and natural acceptance. Facilitator helped explorers to find out their source of motivation for imagination.




Then the next level of harmony was unfolded with the introduction to the nine feelings present in human beings. The nine feelings- Trust, Respect, Affection, Care, Guidance, Reverence, Glory, Gratitude and Love, were described and discussed elaborately. The foundation value Trust and the complete value Love were the ones in which the explorers had most doubts, which were been addressed very patiently by the facilitator.

Correct meaning and definition of Justice was explained and various terms like Mutual Happiness and Mutual Prosperity were been elaborated.Followed by this, the levels of Nature and Existence were been explained to know the role of human being in larger. The session was insightful to understand the co-existence and live with it.
On weekends, every fourth session was devoted for the group discussion. All the explorers were divided in three groups and facilitated by a co-explorer guide to help them in understanding the right meaning of terminologies and resolving various preconditioning. The last session on weekends was planned as a special session, that is Yog Nidra. The sole purpose of the session was to provide rehabilitation to the Self. These sessions were very refreshing for everyone and every explorer gave positive feedback to these sessions.
On the second last day, instead of group discussion, a movie was shown to give a basic idea of role of conscious engineering in our daily life to all the explorers. The movie was followed by a light discussion and queries.
