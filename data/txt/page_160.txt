About IQAC


As per National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) guidelines every accredited institution should establish an Internal Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC) as a pre-accreditation quality sustenance measure. Since quality enhancement is a continuous process, the IQAC becomes a part of the institution's system and works towards realization of the goals of quality enhancement and sustenance.
The prime task of the IQAC is to develop a system for conscious, consistent and catalytic improvement in the overall performance of institutions. AKGEC was accredited by NAAC in 2015 for the first cycle. IQAC established at AKGEC continued to strive for the betterment of processes and setup. The NAAC visited the AKGEC Campus from 22nd to 24th January 2015.

 


Goals of IQAC


Its aim is to introduce a consistent plan of action that would lead the organization towards progress. It involves preparing strategies for –
* Efficient & timely work processes
* Academic research & programs
* Affordable & innovative approaches
* Use of ICT for modernization of education
* Best assessment process for maintaining quality
* Ensuring the best infrastructure to achieve goals


Benefits of IQAC


The following are the top 10 benefits of IQAC in the NAAC accreditation process.
1. Best Practices: IQAC ensures clarity of the work processes and enables the stakeholders to “re-think” the current work processes.
2. Internalization Of Quality Culture: The continuous assessment patterns make it possible to create an internalization of quality education culture in higher education institutions.
3. Better Collaboration of Departments: IQAC ensures a better collaboration between various departments of the HEIs and eradicates the communication gap with frequent evaluation & feedbacks from the stakeholders.
4. Improved Functioning of The HEIs: With a greater level of transparency & assessments, institutions are able to make better decisions and improve their overall functioning.
5. Proper Documentation: IQAC allows the faculty to properly create authentic documentations & keep their records for future reference in the NAAC assessment process.
6. Encourages R&D: IQAC encourages HEIs to pay attention to R&D and make the faculty future-ready by empowering them.
7. Greater Transparency: IQAC peer team verifies all the documents, evidence, and facts and resolves the challenges faced by the HEIs.
8. Project-Based & Service-Based Learning: Students are taught the value of practical knowledge by involving project-based learning as well as service-based learning.
9. Professional Practices: To help children grow academically as well as develop skills, the IQAC team encourages conducting various programs & lectures of professional experts.
10. Global Platform: Unlike traditional teaching-learning culture, IQAC tries to provide a globalized platform to students by inculcating the “think locally- act globally” mindset.
