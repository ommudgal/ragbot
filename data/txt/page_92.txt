Robotics Club 







Robotics Club 



Introduction


The AKGEC Robotics club is a student chapter formed on 8'MAY '2013. The students working here are interested in learning about working with robots. At robotics competitions, teams of students must design and build a robot that can compete against opponents in a series of specific challenges.
The aim of the Robotic club is to inculcate within ourselves the habit of “thinking technologically".
It is an opportunity to apply knowledge creatively, to see how systems interact, both with each other and with the environment.
To develop professional engineering skills among the students which will help them in their professional life.


 



Additional Information


Our club has provided various opportunities to showcase various technical skills of programmers through exceptional events, Initiative, and workshops. For more details and information you can visit our:
