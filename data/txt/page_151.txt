Future Forward: Sustainability Club 





About UNAI (United Nations Academic Impact):With the efforts of the Value Education (VE) Cell, AKGEC, the college became a member of the United Nations Academic Impact (UNAI) initiative on January 9, 2024.

 

UNAI is not just a global initiative, but a powerful platform that aligns institutions of higher education with the United Nations (UN) in supporting and promoting principles of education, sustainability, and global citizenship. Our membership in this prestigious initiative opens up new horizons for collaboration, knowledge exchange, and impactful initiatives on a global scale. It empowers us to contribute meaningfully to addressing pressing global challenges and fostering a culture of peace, sustainability, and social responsibility.
Future Forward: Sustainability ClubIn line with our dedication to the UNAI goals, the VE Cell has launched “Future Forward: Sustainability Club." This club is not merely another extracurricular activity; rather, it is a unique platform designed to engage students in meaningful discussions, hands-on projects, and impactful initiatives related to sustainability.
By joining the Sustainability Club, students will have the opportunity to deepen their understanding and develop practical skills in various critical areas, including climate change, renewable energy, holistic socio-technological structures, environmental justice, and waste reduction. Through collaborative efforts and collective action, we aim to empower students to make tangible contributions towards creating a greener, more sustainable future for generations to come.
