Phoenix, the student society associated with the department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, was formed on 20th September, 2005 by a group of six motivated students of batch 2006. The society formed with an aim to provide a platform to the students on which they enhance their practical knowledge and gain valuable experience in the industrial arena. The society aimed at conducting technical seminars by eminent personalities, workshops on various technical developments and organizing various technical events for the students in the college.
The first event that took place was Electronics Quiz. After that the society has conducted various events on regular basis. The society is continuously increasing its work force year by year. It has been providing to the students a positive gradient.
In 2006-07, the major hits were the Rover, Radix and the Instant Khichari held at the intra-college tech fest “TECH@VIBRATIONS’06" and the strength of society increased to 28 volunteers and co-ordinators. In 2007-08, the robotics event “Robonoid" organised by the society in “TECH TRISHNA'08"- was the most popular technical event in the history of college.
Maintaining its trend of enhancing technical skills and sharpening young minds, Phoenix kept its journey on by conducting 'Ecrire de conquirer'- an online technical article writing competition. The articles with the maximum likes were rewarded. As always the event On Board Quiz was a big hit. The event VIBEQUP-“Visual Buzzing and Entertaining Quiz of Puzzles was admired by all attracting intense participation. The final round held at amphitheatre gave an all way round fun and frolic entertainment to all with its multi-layered process.
In February’ 13, Phoenix family welcomed new faces and the strength reached a total of 45. Together with Samveg and Oorja, Phoenix conducted Robotrix classes to give a fundamental understanding of basic concepts involved in designing a robot. Keeping its statistics consistent – Robofestinate, organised during tech trishna'13 was again a great success. The other events organised during tech fest were Identomyst and Series parallel, which were equally appreciated and included mind tickling questions based on basic electrical and electronics engineering.

 DESOTRIX
On 8th and 9th November 2017 our society PHOENIX conducted an event DESOTRIX. The event witnessed ample participation and enthusiasm from the students of every year.
The first round involved the solving of technical riddles and puzzles on the basis of which the students were given points which gave them benefit in the subsequent round.
The next day marked the beginning of the final round. This round involved circuit designing and students with lesser points could also increase their points by debugging few circuits made by our coordinators. The points were used to purchase various components and hence design the circuit.
The participants were being judged on various parameters like time taken to design the circuit, accuracy of the outputs, number of components used etc. and finally the winners were being agnized.

 REPORT ON PLEXUS‘15

Pre-Event Round


This was an optional round for those students who wished to take a head start. All they needed to do was message a technical article they like to the official page of Phoenix on Facebook and accordingly, their articles were posted. The top TWO articles with maximum likes got a point advantage.


First Round


This was a pen-paper cum visual round. A 20-marks question paper was set, that included 10 questions on logos of popular technical companies and 10 questions based on taglines of popular electronic brands, each question carried 1 mark.
The second part of this round involved a video based on emerging technologies shown to the participants, such as 5G technology, Internet of Things, etc., followed by a couple of questions based on the same, each had a weight age of 5 marks.
Based on the pre-round and the above stated round, 15 teams having the maximum marks in minimum time were shortlisted for the final round.
This round helped the students exercise their brains in finding the appropriate and the most suitable article. This made them go through a variety of new technologies. The paper round tested and enhanced their knowledge about popular companies.


Final Round


The teams eligible for this round were given a riddle. The solution of the riddle gave the name of a place in the college, for example BB Shed, Canteen, etc. The teams needed to solve the riddle and get to the place. Once they reached the given spot, they were given a sealed envelope. They brought it back to the starting point, without tampering the seal. The catch was such that three teams were supposed to reach one spot, the team reaching first progressed. So, this was a race against time as well as other teams.
Once the team reached the starting point, the seal of the envelope was opened. There was another riddle that gave the name of a famous scientist. The team doing both the jobs, bringing back the envelope and deciphering the name of the scientist, in the minimum amount of time secured maximum points.
This was followed by a rapid fire quiz having questions from domains like communication, space, embedded etc. The cumulative points of all these parts decided the winner. In case of a tie, another tie-breaker buzzer round was supposed to be conducted but no such situation arose.

After a couple of fun-filled days, the following students took the honours:
