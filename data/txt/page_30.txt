B. Tech. Civil Engineering 30
Civil Engineering is the art of directing the sources of power in nature for the use and convenience of man, for improvement of quality of life. The theory and practice of Civil Engineering is basically applied in the construction of buildings & structures, roads, bridges, aqueducts, canals, river navigation ports, docks and harbours.At AKGEC, B.Tech course in Civil Engineering is offered with intake capacity of 60.The goal of the department is to produce high quality technical manpower needed by industry, R&D organizations and academic institutions and above all to meet the engineering needs of the nation.The faculty comprises of galaxies of qualified and experienced teachers with Ph.D and M Tech from premier institutions like IITs and NITs.
The academic activities of the Department emphasize deep understanding of fundamental principles, development of creative ability to handle the challenges of Civil Engineering and the analytical ability to solve problems which are interdisciplinary in nature.The Department also encourages its students to engage in extra-curricular and co-curricular activities, essential for development and nurturing of team spirit, developing organizational skills and inculcating good moral values and positive work culture.

 Vision & Mission
VisionTo produce professionally competent, socially sensitive, motivated and dedicated Civil Engineers capable of working in a multicultural global environment.


Mission1. Educating the students who are, would be "leaders of tomorrow" in academia, government, industry and entrepreneurial pursuit, through  learner-centric teaching methodology of theory and practical’s and develop the ability to solve problems related to Civil Engineering, individually and in teams.
2. To develop knowledge of fundamental principles and innovative technologies through research within core areas of Civil Engineering and in collaboration with other disciplines that is distinguished by its impact on academic, industry and society.
3. To create in students deep awareness of ethical responsibilities to face the professional and from local, national and international level challenges.
