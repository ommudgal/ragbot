You choreograph every song you listen to.
You practice dance routines under your desk.
You don’t walk places, you dance there".


 

Taal comprises of innovative, talented and versatile students as its coordinators and members. The society came into existence in the year 2004 with the aim of exploring the college students to move their body to the beats and rhythm of life.The team practices various dance forms and participates in different intra and inter college events. This enables us to explore the actual competitive world of dance, which intensifies the spirit of dancing within us.
“We dance to express not to impress"
