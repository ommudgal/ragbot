Nature Club 




In view of the increasing problems of global warming, deforestation, ozone layer depletion, pollution and many more due to modern development, it is believed globally that the awareness about the present status of the environment to sensitize people about the inherent relationships with Nature has become very important.
With the above objective, Value Education Cell, AKGEC has established ‘Nature Club’ which is committed not only to spreading awareness about the problems but also to motivate students to find solutions to the problems in the light of inherent relationships. The effort will improve the competence of students to contribute towards the sustainability of nature and avoid environmental degradation in their individual capacity as well as in groups.
