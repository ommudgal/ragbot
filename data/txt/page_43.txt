Policy and Process for Refund of Caution Money 




The caution money and security deposit are refundable after deduction of dues, if any, only after the student finally leaves the College on completion of the course.
Each student, studying in the final year of his/her course, is required to fill up clearance form (No Dues Form) and submit the same to the Accounts Office, before leaving the College. The Accounts Office processes the forms and distributes the cheques of caution money at the time of College Convocation. For this the students are individually informed through letters and e-mails. Majority of the caution money cheques are distributed in one go in a single day through the aforesaid process. Those students who fail to attend the Convocation Ceremony may collect their cheques on any other working day during College hours. Year wise details of refund of Caution money along with listing of students who have been paid the same are attached.
