 Visit of Volleyball Team to Malviya National Institute of technology (MNIT, Jaipur)
An Eight-member volleyball team of our college from B. tech 3rd and 4th year participated in Malviya sports Tournament 2023 held at MNIT, Jaipur w.e.f. 23/3/23 to 25/3/23. The tournament was inaugurated by Shri Ram Kumar Sehrawat a former Indian basketball player and coach of junior Indian team as Chief Guest.
It was a proud moment that we were selected to participate as one among ten teams from various prestigious Institutes. The ten teams were divided on four pools and the matches were held on league cum knockout basis.
Our first league match was held with University College of Engineering and Technology (UCET, Bikaner) who were the champions of last year’s Malviya Sports Tournament. So, we were pitted against a very strong team, However, we played well and to the best of our ability but lost by a close margin in a best of 3 games with the score being 25(AKGEC)-27(UCET) in the first set and 23(AKGEC)-25(UCET) in the second set. As four of our very good players from B. tech 2nd year could not join because of their End Semester University Exams, the result would have been different and in all probability a victory in our favour.
The Second league match was to be played against NIT, Uttarakhand who did not turn up and we got a “walkover” victory. As a result, we were declared runners up of our pool. However, overall championship of the game was won by MNIT, Jaipur with UCET, Bikaner as the runners up.
We are very thankful to our director Dr. R.K. Agarwal for allowing us to participate in this prestigious tournament. We are also thankful to our DSW Prof. V.K. Parashar and Sports Officer Mr. Pratap Singh for supporting as well as motivating us to participate in the tournament. This tournament provided us with new experience and strategies to work on our sport which will help us to perform better in the upcoming AKTU zonal and states tournament.
