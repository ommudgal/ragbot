A cadre of dynamic individuals, possessing a diverse spectrum of aptitudes, and perspectives, constitutes Horizon. The organization aspires to cultivate the technical and managerial sagacity of students, equipping them to navigate perpetually.
The logo aptly expresses the goal of the society. The saffron area represents freedom of innovation, ideas, and intellect. The Steel Grey part represents determination, discipline, and dedication. When these two areas converge, any tough job becomes easier. The logo points towards both dimensions, hence HORIZON – exploring extremities and beyond.
